# README

This is the readme for the Month 10 files. Unlike recent months, these are _not_ Jupyter notebooks, and will _not_ render in the browser when you view them on Github. This file contains documentation for how to run
them and what other libraries are used.

## Requirements

You'll need the following Python libaries:
- streamlit
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy

## Running the notebooks

Download the Month 10 folder locally to your machine.  Navigate to the main folder and, from the command line, run `streamlit run "Streamlit Demos.py"`.  A browser window should open for you.  The folder already contains a `config.toml` file that disables browser statistics collection and runs the web server on `127.0.0.1`, to make it accessible only from your computer.
