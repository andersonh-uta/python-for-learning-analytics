    "# Database-style joins\n",

    "Say we have two datasets.  One is a list of students in a course, plus all the assignments they've submitted and their grades on those assignments.  The dataset has one row for each assignment, and looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Student ID | Assignment | Grade |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| 001 | Midterm | 90 |\n",
    "| 001 | Final | 78 |\n",
    "| 002 | Midterm | 100 |\n",
    "| 002 | Final | 100 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Our second dataset is a list of students and their majors:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Student ID | Major |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| 001 |  Physics |\n",
    "| 002 |  History |\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to do some analysis of how grades differ by major, we'll need to combine these datasets somehow.  We want to get a dataset that looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Student ID | Assignment | Grade | Major |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| 001 | Midterm | 90 | Physics |\n",
    "| 001 | Final | 78 | Physics |\n",
    "| 002 | Midterm | 100 | History |\n",
    "| 002 | Final | 100 | History |\n",
    "\n",
    "But, there's an important question we need to answer.  If we have a student in one dataset but not the other, how do we want to handle that?  E.g., if we have a student who hasn't declared a major yet, and isn't in the second dataset?  We really only have two sensible options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Don't include them in the final dataset.  We don't know their major, so it could throw things off.  If we want to do this, we'll use an *inner join:* combine two datasets, and only keep observation that have a corresponding entry in *both*.\n",
    "2. Include them, but set their major to a missing value.  We can then analyze \"no/missing major\" students to see if there's any patterns with them.  This would be a *left join:* keep *all* observation from one dataset (we get to pick which one); if someone doesn't appear in the other one, just use missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there's also a *right join*, which is the same thing as a left join, but you just switch which dataset is the \"keep everything from here\" dataset, and an *outer join* (sometimes called a *full join*), which says \"keep all observations from both datasets.\"  Right joins are pretty rare, since most people just use left joins; outer joins are uncommon, since they're not as widely useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we join two datasets, we need to specify how to determine if two records \"match.\"  We don't have a lot of flexibility here; we provide a column (or list of columns), and rows are combined if they have the same values from those columns.  This can sometimes cause issues: imagine joining two datasets based on first name.  Let's say it's a dataset about US Presidents.  If you do that, then \"James Madison\" and \"James Monroe\" will both match, and you'll get a messed up dataset.  In this case, you'd want to probably specify a join on first, middle, and last name, so that all three have to be identical for two records to be considered a match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas lets you do all of these kinds of joins using the `pd.merge()` function or the `DataFrame.merge()` method.  Let's make a small dataset and show what each one of these looks like."
