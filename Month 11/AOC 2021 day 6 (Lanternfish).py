There are a bunch of lanternfish, each with an internal "timer".
At every time step, each fish's timer ticks down by 1.  When the timer
reaches 0, the lanternfish spawns a new fish, and resets its timer to 7.
The new lanternfish spawns with a timer of 9.

How many lanternfish are there are 100 days?
