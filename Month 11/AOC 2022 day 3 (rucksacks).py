The input file contains a bunch of long lines of jumbled letters.
Each letter has a score:
    a-z = 1-26 respectively
    A-Z = 27-52 respectively

On each line, one letter should appear in both the first and second half
of the line.  What is the sum of the scores of these letters, summed
over all lines in the input file?
