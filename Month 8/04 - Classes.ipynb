    "\n",
    "First, a definition.  An _object_, in programming terms, is just a fancy word for \"thing.\"  It's the most abstract and general kind of thing that a thing can be.  (Unless you're one of those cool functional programming languages like Haskell, or some systems programming languages like C).  In Python, an object does two main things:\n",
    "1. It stores data inside it.\n",
    "2. It stores some functions inside it (these are the methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "`class`es are most often used for a few things:\n",
    "1. When you have _mutable data_, and function that only make sense on that kind of data, and which usually need to make changes to that data.\n",
    "2. (Specific to Python) Overriding some special methods to change how, e.g., addition works for your class.\n",
    "3. Writing functions that need to _only_ work on certain kinds of data.  E.g.: if you create a class for a 6-sided die, you might write a method `roll()`, so you can say `die.roll()`.  But it doesn't make sense to `roll()`, say, a list.\n",
    "4. Writing functions that have the same name, but do different things depending on the class they're attached to.\n",
    "    - This is how scikit-learn uses them.  Every model's class has a `.fit()` method; each class defines this totally differently, but it does the same thing, conceptually.\n",
    "    - This is a broader design pattern called _multiple dispatch._  In general: the same function name behaves differently depending on the types of its arguments.  Class methods implement a special case of multiple dispatch--_single dispatch_--where only the first argument is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python calls its object `class`es.  Let's build a simple one.  We'll make a simple counter that we can increment."
