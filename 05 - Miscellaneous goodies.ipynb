    "# Numba: Speedy speedy math\n",
    "\n",
    "As fast as Numpy is for doing math, it's still not as fast as we could get.  The fastest possible code would be *compiled* ahead of time down to machine code.  This requires a *compiler*: a program that reads the code we write, \"translates\" it into the 1s and 0s that the computer understands, and usually performs a lot of extra optimizations along the way to get us faster code with the same outputs.  Unfortunately, Python is an interpreted language--it gets executed one line at a time, with very little optimization--which makes writing it easier in some cases, but at the cost of speed.  Even Numpy is still interpreted.  Numpy is using a lot of compiled C code--which is very fast--but there's still Python interpretation that needs to happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter Numba: a library that will compile your functions for you, using something called *just in time* (or JIT) compilation.  The \"just in time\" part isn't something we need to worry about, though.  Basically, Numba gives you free extra speed.  Sometimes a *lot*, with some tweaks to your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Install Numba with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install numba\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the currently available versions of Numba require a Numpy version no later than 1.20; the current Numpy versions you can get through Conda are generally newer.  So you may need to use the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install numba numpy<=1.20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then import the `jit` and `njit` decorators.  `njit` is generally faster, but doesn't work on as much Python code (it requires things to be more directly translatable to simpler languages, but it can generate much faster code if that's the case).  `jit` is more flexible, but not always as fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "`jit`/`njit` are what are called *decorators.*  This is a piece of pretty complex Python concept that I've intentionally not covered.  It's closely related to the idea of a *closure* in general programming/computer science, but for our purposes, we're going to treat it like a little bit of magic and not worry about what's going on.  Basically: we write `@jit`/`@njit` on the line right before the function we want to speed up.  There are a few arguments we can pass to the decorators, e.g., `@njit(nogil=True)`.  Not having the parentheses uses all the default settings."

    "\n",
    "If you have an NVidia GPU, you can install the `cupy` library, which gives you Numpy arrays, but on your GPU.  This has some tradeoffs compared to normal Numpy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cupy is generally a drop-in replacement for Numpy *in your code*--they try very hard to re-implement as much of the Numpy API as possible, so that it magically \"just works\" on the GPU.  If you try to pass a Cupy array to a library that expects Numpy arrays, it might throw an error.\n",
    "    - Some changes to recent versions of Numpy are *incompatible* with Cupy, e.g., using `np.random.default_rng()`.\n",
    "    - Some functions' positional arguments may also be different from Numpy, but passing function arguments by name usually solves this.\n",
    "- Cupy will generally be faster than Numpy for the same operations, especially massively parallelizeable ones like matrix multiplication.\n",
    "- Because Cupy is running on your GPU, you will be limited by *your GPU's available RAM*, which will almost always be less than your main system RAM.\n",
    "    - You can get computers/servers/cloud instances with hundreds of gigabytes of RAM.  It might cost a few hundred dollars (or more), but realistically, a few hundred dollars of main system RAM costs about as much as one or two decent GPUs.  Each of those GPUs might have 12-16gb of RAM.  So if you happen to have really, really big arrays, you probably need to use Numpy.\n",
    "- Cupy is really designed for NVidia GPUs, and may not run well on AMD GPUs.  I don't think it'll run at all on Intel graphics.\n",
    "    - There is [expermental support for AMD GPUs](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/v11.0.0b2/install.html#using-cupy-on-amd-gpu-experimental), but since it's only experimental, it may be prone to crashes/bugs/performance issues at this point in time.  (I don't have access to an AMD GPU to test with).\n",
    "- As is generally true for GPU programming, getting data to and from the GPU is the hardest part.  Generally, you'll want to move as many things to the GPU (i.e., into Cupy arrays) as you can, do all your array logic there, and then move them back.  Try to make sure you're only operating on Cupy arrays using other Cupy arrays to avoid the CPU-to-GPU data transfer bottleneck.\n",
    "\n",
    "GPUs excel at *matrix multiplication* and *dot products of very large arrays*--so if you happen to be doing matrix multiplication, expect *huge* speedups.  A lot of other array operations are faster on GPUs too, but matrix multiplication is the most extreme and noteworthy example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing Cupy requires installing the `cudatoolkit` package through conda.  This package is required to run general-purpose compute on your NVidia GPU, and it will require that you have a current NVidia driver installed *system-wide* (you can't install NVidia drivers through conda--or at least, you can't do that and expect them to work well).\n",

They're extremely simple forms of key-value storage (like even more simple JSONs): all keys and values must be strings (or bytes) when accessing a database via Python.  DBM databases aren't very fault-tolerant, robust, or flexible as other database options, so their use cases are fairly limited these days.  (especially with SQLite--see a bit further down in this notebook--being as easy to use, similarly fast, and way more flexible and widely available).  That said, sometimes the simplicity of a DBM database is all you need.\n",

Sometimes this simplicity is all you need, which can make `dbm` pretty useful in spite of its limitations. (other database interfaces require more code and more complexity).  The only tricky-ish part is that the file modes are a bit different than normal files; check the `dbm` documentation in Python for details."

These are generally on different machines: the server is running on, well, a server somewhere, and the client program is running on your machine, sending your queries to the server to be executed.  This is great for something like a central database for a company, school, or department.\n",

SQLite differs from other SQL implementations in a few important ways:\n",

    "If you know some SQL, you can use pretty much all of that knowledge in SQLite.  Joins, filters, creating table, etc.  The only thing to be careful of is how SQLite handles data types: it is not as strict as other SQL databases when it comes to enforcing types.  It'll often coerce types, and it's happy to have a column that stores a mix of integer and text values.  Usually this isn't an issue--if you're using SQLite, you probably aren't doing something where the type checking and such has to be handled by the database itself.  Either you can handle that in your own code, or you have little enough data it isn't an issue, or something else.  But, it can be a bit of a stumbling block for people coming from other SQL implementations."
