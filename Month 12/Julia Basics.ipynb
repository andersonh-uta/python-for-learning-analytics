    "Some major and obvious differences from Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Defining functions uses `function foo() [code] end`, not `def foo(): [code, ends when indent resets]`.  Julia doesn't use indentation for anything syntactic--it uses `end` to mark the end of a code block (e.g. a function definition, a loop, a conditional).  *You* should still use indentation though to make your code readable!\n",
    "- `elseif` insead of `elif`\n",
    "- Using `/` for division will always return a float, which can cause some issues for this particular code when the inputs get really large, so `div()` is used to do integer division.  (integers in, integers out).\n",
    "- `@macro` is a _syntactic macro._  This is a really hard to explain idea, but it's basically like a function that takes in _code_--not values--as its arguments, manipulates that code, and returns the new code.\n",
    "    - This it not just manipulating input _text_; it actually works on the _code itself._\n",
    "    - We aren't going to worry about writing our own macros.\n",
    "- `.` syntax for mapping/broadcasting.  `foo.(x)` automatically vectorized `foo` over the input `x`; Julia does this for you for every function in the language.\n",
    "    - For infix operatirs, it's `.+`--the `.` comes before the operator, not after it.  So: `x .+ y` is element-wise addition.\n",
    "- Ranges are created using the `:` operator, and include the upper bound.  (Python's `range()` function excludes the upper bound).\n",
    "- Speed.  Compare the following to the Python equivalent in the companion notebook.  The Python version is ~100x slower.\n",
    "    - Yes, we could speed the Python code up using some tricks like `@numba.jit`, but Julia is fast _out of the box._"

    "The `::Int64` syntax is how Julia does type annotations.  `x::Int64` means \"`x` should be of type `Int64` (a 64-bit integer).\"  Whenever you call a function in Julia, it looks at the types of every single argument, and finds whichever definition 1) uses the name of the function you're calling, and 2) is the most specific match to the values you're passing.\n",
    "\n",

A method in Python is, conceptually, no different from saying \"`something(x)`, but throw an error if `x` isn't the right type.\"  Different classes can each implement their own version of `something()`, so really, each definition is kind of just different code, given the same name, and which instance of the code gets called depends on the type of `x`.

Nowadays, on desktops and laptops, this is all but guaranteed to be 64 bit integers, but it could be 32 bits on older hardware, or some single-board computers like Raspberry Pis.  Julia looks for a definition of `my_function` that takes an `Int64` as its first argument; it finds one, so it runs that.\n",
